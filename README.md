# NLP Toxicity Detection and Compliance Analysis

## Overview  
This project focuses on evaluating and improving the safety and reliability of language model outputs.  
Over 10,000 summarization results were analyzed to detect, quantify, and reduce toxic or harmful language in automated text generation systems.  
The goal was to ensure model outputs align with organizational compliance and ethical communication standards.

## Objectives  
- Identify and measure instances of toxicity within NLP-generated summaries.  
- Develop a custom toxicity scoring framework using human-labeled datasets.  
- Visualize toxicity patterns and risk reduction progress for leadership insights.  

## Approach and Methodology  

### 1. Data Processing  
- Processed more than 10,000 model-generated summaries using Python.  
- Cleaned and standardized text data for consistent toxicity evaluation.  
- Integrated human-labeled datasets to train and validate toxicity detection models.  

### 2. Toxicity Scoring System  
- Developed a custom scoring system to quantify toxicity levels across multiple linguistic dimensions (e.g., hate speech, insults, threats).  
- Incorporated rule-based filters and statistical thresholds to improve detection accuracy.  
- Achieved a 95% reduction in harmful outputs by fine-tuning model generation parameters.  

### 3. Visualization and Reporting  
- Created interactive dashboards using **Matplotlib** and **Excel** to monitor toxicity trends and compliance metrics.  
- Visualized temporal and categorical patterns of toxicity for performance tracking.  
- Enabled leadership to assess the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies and model safety improvements.  

## Tools and Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy — data analysis and preprocessing  
- Matplotlib — visual analytics and dashboards  
- OpenPyXL / XlsxWriter — Excel dashboard integration  
- Custom NLP models with human-labeled datasets for toxicity scoring  

## Outcomes  
- 95% reduction in harmful or non-compliant outputs.  
- Established a reproducible framework for automated content safety monitoring.  
- Improved trust, reliability, and compliance of NLP model outputs used in production environments.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Integrate advanced deep learning toxicity classifiers such as Detoxify or Perspective API.  
- Automate dashboard updates through scheduled reporting pipelines.  
- Extend framework to multilingual datasets for global compliance evaluation.
